### Usage
#### Setup
At the start of each shift or whenver you want to start using it:
1. run the .exe file. (either by finding it or searching it up)
2. Enter the campaign. Either 6, 18, 30
It is now ready to go.
#### Using
1. Press Alt key
2. Sit back and wait for it to do its thing  
It will stop before it actually enters the interaction into Kete  
Some things to remember (**Requirements**)
 - You need to be on the upgrade amount column when presing insert regardless of whether it is a conversion or not.
 - The Kete tab need to be the right of the workbook everytime you want to use the script.
 - If you are looking at the kete tab you should be able to see the interaction button as well as the search bar at the same time. It is easy to do as long as you dont have a silly small window.
 - It is built off of a 1920x1080 screen so your screen needs to be this size. You might be having scaling issues so check setting on your computer.  
Here is a screenshot to show you the requirements:

Ignore the black marks as they are put there for privacy reasons. The highlighted parts are what is important.

#### Example

### Versioning
I am using semantic versioning. No originality here just using the guidelines found at https://semver.org/.  
In short, this will mean Major will be big updates. Minor are any updates that aren't too big and also arent backward compatible. Lastly, patches are simple fixes that are not required but might fix a little behaviour. Always should be backward compatible.
